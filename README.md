### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

My main difficulty here was a lack of comfort with JavaScript so the labs did not hlp with that much. Independent work blocks were most beneficial for this

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I might style it more and try to improve the user experience.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I did not demo this week.

### Open-source libraries used

- none

### Shout out
